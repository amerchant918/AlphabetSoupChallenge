## How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
I chose two layers one with 10 neurons and the other with 8. By trial and error this is the best combination with an accuracy score of 53%.
## Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
In Order to achieve the optimal model performance I would’ve had to further classify the columns and remove highly distributed columns; along with modifying some of the factors such as the layers, neurons, epochs. 
##	If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
I would’ve chosen the Random Forest Classifier as it usually has a higher accuracy rate than a neural network. The data that we were working with might’ve required further processing as it was tabular and nonlinear.
